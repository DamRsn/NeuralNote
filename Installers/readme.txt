You're about to install NeuralNote on your computer.

NeuralNote is an audio-to-MIDI plugin that uses Spotify's BasicPitch neural network for transcription.

Everything in NeuralNote runs locally on your computer. No audio data is sent to any server, and NeuralNote does not collect any data from you.
